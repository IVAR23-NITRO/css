            The Church of St. Peter and St. Paul is a Roman Catholic church located in the Antakalnis neighbourhood of Vilnius, Lithuania. Constructed between 1668 and 1701, it is the centerpiece of a former monastery complex of the Canons Regular of the Lateran. The church is considered a masterpiece of Baroque architecture in the Polishâ€“Lithuanian Commonwealth. This picture shows the central nave of the church, looking south-westwards towards the entrance. The nave is dominated by plain white walls that contrast with opulent decorations elsewhere in the church. It is decorated with colorful depictions of the Stations of the Cross and evenly spaced sculptures of the Twelve Apostles, as well as a number of torture scenes placed within niches featuring martyrs from the persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire. The pulpit, designed in the Rococo style, can be seen on the right of the photograph, while the pipe organ is visible above the entrance in the background.
